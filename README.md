# Permission Guard

Permission Guard is a Flutter package that provides an easy way to handle permissions in your Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of requesting, checking, and managing user permissions, allowing you to focus on the core functionality of your app.

## Features

- Requesting permissions from the user
- Checking the status of permissions
- Handling different permission scenarios (granted, denied, restricted, etc.)
- Providing UI components for permission-related screens

## Getting Started

To start using Permission Guard in your Flutter project, you need to add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  permission_guard: ^1.0.0
```

For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to the package's [documentation](https://example.com).

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Permission Guard to request location permission:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:permission_guard/permission_guard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Permission Guard Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              PermissionStatus status = await PermissionGuard.requestPermission(Permission.location);
              if (status == PermissionStatus.granted) {
                // Permission granted, proceed with location functionality
              } else {
                // Permission denied or restricted, handle accordingly
              }
            },
            child: Text('Request Location Permission'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Permission Guard also provides a UI permission request feature. You can use the `PermissionRequestScreen` widget to display a UI screen that asks the user for all necessary permissions at once. If the user skips this step, the app will request permissions when they are required for specific features.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:permission_guard/permission_guard.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Permission Guard Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  builder: (_) => PermissionRequestScreen(
                    permissions: [
                      Permission.location,
                      Permission.camera,
                      Permission.storage,
                    ],
                    onPermissionDenied: () {
                      // Handle denied permissions
                    },
                    onPermissionGranted: () {
                      // Handle granted permissions
                    },
                  ),
                ),
              );
            },
            child: Text('Request All Permissions'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
